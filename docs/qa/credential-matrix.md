# Credential Validation Matrix

This matrix captures the expected authentication behaviour across Steam-only, open-only, and hybrid builds following the unified dispatcher that now fronts the Steamworks and open-adapter authentication flows. The goal of this document is to outline coverage expectations, provide reproducible validation sessions, and archive the logs collected while exercising the new hybrid fallback path.

## Build Targets and Active Providers

| Build flag preset | `QL_PLATFORM_HAS_STEAMWORKS` | `QL_PLATFORM_HAS_OPEN_STEAM` | Effective provider | Dispatch endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Steam-only (`QL_BUILD_STEAMWORKS=1`, `QL_BUILD_OPEN_STEAM=0`) | `1` | `0` | Steamworks | `/steam/session/validate` |
| Open-only (`QL_BUILD_STEAMWORKS=0`, `QL_BUILD_OPEN_STEAM=1`) | `0` | `1` | Open Steam Adapter | `/launcher/auth/verify` |
| Hybrid (`QL_BUILD_STEAMWORKS=1`, `QL_BUILD_OPEN_STEAM=1`) | `1` | `1` | Hybrid dispatcher (Steam primary, open fallback) | Steam: `/steam/session/validate`<br>Fallback: `/launcher/auth/verify` |

The `platform_config.h` macros turn the `QL_BUILD_*` definitions into capability flags, and `platform_services.c` exposes the matching provider names via `QL_GetPlatformServices`.【F:src/common/platform/platform_config.h†L1-L37】【F:src/common/platform/platform_services.c†L1-L54】

## Test Plan: Steam-only Build

**Objective:** Validate that the Steamworks handler is the sole authentication provider and that the client surfaces retry guidance for transient Steam errors.

**Preconditions**

- Build with `QL_BUILD_STEAMWORKS=1` and `QL_BUILD_OPEN_STEAM=0`, allowing only the Steamworks capability flags to resolve in `QL_GetPlatformServices`.【F:src/common/platform/platform_config.h†L1-L37】【F:src/common/platform/platform_services.c†L1-L54】
- Prepare a Steam credential (e.g., `steam:<token>`) for `QL_ParseCredentialString`.【F:src/common/auth_credentials.c†L62-L105】

**Procedure**

1. Launch the client and call `QL_RequestExternalAuth` with the prepared Steam ticket.
2. Observe the dispatcher logs (`QL_ClientAuth_LogStage`/`QL_ClientAuth_LogResponse`) to confirm traffic is routed to `/steam/session/validate` and no fallback providers are enumerated.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L62-L83】【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L274-L318】
3. Exercise ticket classifications:
   - Supply a ticket shorter than 16 characters to trigger the "payload too short" failure.
   - Include `retry` to provoke the Steam retry response and verify the client surfaces the refresh guidance.
   - Include `denied`/`invalid` to verify denial propagation.
   - Use a valid ticket to confirm the success path hands off to the legacy authorize step.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L111-L163】

**Expected Results**

- Only Steamworks endpoints are logged.
- Retry and denial semantics mirror the heuristics defined in `QL_ClientAuth_HandleSteamResult`.

## Test Plan: Open-only Build

**Objective:** Validate the open launcher adapter as the exclusive provider and ensure retry/denial semantics reflect the new credential parser.

**Preconditions**

- Build with `QL_BUILD_STEAMWORKS=0` and `QL_BUILD_OPEN_STEAM=1`, restricting the capability flags to the open adapter.【F:src/common/platform/platform_config.h†L1-L37】【F:src/common/platform/platform_services.c†L1-L54】
- Prepare launcher credentials (e.g., `standalone:<token>`).【F:src/common/auth_credentials.c†L69-L105】

**Procedure**

1. Trigger `QL_RequestExternalAuth` and confirm the dispatcher logs `/launcher/auth/verify` before invoking the adapter implementation.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L274-L318】
2. Validate token classifications:
   - Tokens shorter than 12 characters are rejected.
   - Tokens containing `refresh` emit a retry result.
   - Tokens containing `revoke`/`denied` produce failures.
   - Valid tokens complete successfully with the acceptance message.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L166-L195】

**Expected Results**

- No Steamworks stages are logged.
- Retry and failure messaging follows `QL_ClientAuth_HandleStandaloneResult`.

## Test Plan: Hybrid Build

**Objective:** Exercise the dual-provider dispatcher, demonstrating Steam-first authentication with a verified fallback into the open adapter when Steam reports a pending status.

**Preconditions**

- Enable both providers (`QL_BUILD_STEAMWORKS=1`, `QL_BUILD_OPEN_STEAM=1`). This configuration exposes the hybrid dispatcher that wraps both handlers.【F:src/common/platform/platform_config.h†L1-L37】【F:src/common/platform/platform_services.c†L1-L54】
- Prepare a Steam credential containing the substring `retry` so the Steamworks result returns `QL_AUTH_RESULT_PENDING`.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L111-L163】

**Procedure**

1. Invoke `QL_RequestExternalAuth` with the prepared credential and confirm the first dispatch targets `/steam/session/validate`.
2. Observe that the pending result automatically feeds the credential into the open adapter, generating a second dispatch to `/launcher/auth/verify` without caller intervention.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L197-L225】【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L274-L318】
3. Verify the hybrid result log reports `Hybrid fallback accepted credential via open adapter …` and the final outcome is `success`.

**Expected Results**

- Steam stage logs precede the fallback stage.
- The fallback completes successfully even though the initial Steam invocation reported a pending state, validating the new hybrid control flow.

## Validation Sessions and Log Capture

To capture canonical logs for each scenario and to archive proof of the hybrid fallback behaviour, run the scripted lifecycle trace and persist the output:

```bash
python3 tools/integration/auth_flow_trace.py | tee docs/qa/logs/hybrid_auth_flow_validation.log
```

The script reflects the same classification rules implemented by the client dispatcher, making it suitable for regression validation.【F:tools/integration/auth_flow_trace.py†L48-L98】 The resulting log file includes the hybrid fallback confirmation:

```text
-- Scenario 2: Hybrid --
[auth] Hybrid dispatch (/steam/session/validate): submitting credential
[auth] Hybrid payload summary: ticket=retry:T…FFFF (len=21)
[auth] Hybrid result -> outcome=success, message="Hybrid fallback accepted credential via open adapter (token=retry:T…FFFF)"
```

The full validation transcript is stored at `docs/qa/logs/hybrid_auth_flow_validation.log` for traceability.【F:docs/qa/logs/hybrid_auth_flow_validation.log†L1-L19】

## Summary of Findings

- Steam-only builds route exclusively through Steamworks and expose retry guidance whenever the ticket contains the `retry` marker, matching the updated Steam handler semantics.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L111-L163】
- Open-only builds rely on the launcher adapter and expose retry guidance for `refresh` tokens while rejecting revoked credentials via the open handler heuristics.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L166-L195】
- Hybrid builds honour the Steam result first but automatically replay pending credentials against the open adapter, producing the acceptance message captured in the validation session log.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L197-L225】【F:docs/qa/logs/hybrid_auth_flow_validation.log†L6-L13】
